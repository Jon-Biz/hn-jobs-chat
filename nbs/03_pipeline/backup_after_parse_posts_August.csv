Juniper is working to improve the messy financial infrastructure for US Healthcare. We've built an automated end-to-end insurance billing system for recurring care, starting with Autism clinics.
At Juniper, we’ve built an end-to-end billing system. We’ve built something really good, something that clinicians really need and love. We automate and abstract the tedious, manual, repetitive work that goes into the administrative duties of running a clinic, so that clinicians can do what they do best — providing high quality care. It starts with ingesting clinic data, and then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles (we never send anything to collections).
We are a team of ~30 with strong product market fit — in Q4 last year we’ve had to push out onboarding because engineering can’t build quickly enough, something we’ve scaled out of and will hopefully not bottleneck growth again. You’ll be working with an engineering leadership team from AWS and Stripe to get clinicians back to work delivering care for kids.

Hi, I'm William, the co-founder and CEO of Maestro AI. Throughout my career in software engineering, I've repeatedly witnessed how fragmented workflows and broken processes can stifle even the most brilliant teams. That's why I started Maestro AI. Our mission is to streamline the process of software development, turning chaos into clarity so that teams can accomplish more.
Maestro AI provides real-time, comprehensive insights for teams so everyone can easily see what's happening, how projects are progressing, and where people are blocked. We eliminate information silos by aggregating data from multiple collaborative tools like Slack, Jira, Notion, and Github, enabling seamless communication and informed decision-making across the entire organization.
Here's a recent demo video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xd7_0fURLxU
We're an early-stage, venture-backed startup, and you'll have the opportunity to shape our product and culture from the ground up.
We're looking for someone who takes pride in their craft, pushes their limits, and takes action to create something new. Our stack is Python on the backend and React/Redux/Typescript on the frontend. We're training our own models in addition to using existing LLMs.
To apply: Please email careers+hn at getmaestro.ai with your resume, your Github, and a short note detailing a project you've enjoyed working on. View a full list of our roles here: https://maestroai.notion.site/Maestro-AI-Careers-51385f9fca9...

We’re building SMB accounting software API-first so that it can be integrated directly into software platforms where business owners already work. Our customers are vertical software platforms in the vein of Toast, MindBody or Housecall Pro that help small business owners start, run and scale their business with workflows and financial products. We help them serve their customers who are stuck exporting all their data out of these systems into CSVs and importing it back into other accounting software.
Integrating with our accounting APIs gives business owners automation & accounting workflows directly within their core software while the software platforms get to solve one their customers’ biggest pain points: worrying about bookkeeping & finances.
We’re looking for a founding frontend engineer who is excited about building a company and team as well as building better software for SMBs.

14,liuhenry,2024-08-01 22:42:28,"Lithos Carbon | Full-Stack Engineer, Data Scientist/Engineer, and Applied Statistician | Hybrid (SF Bay Area, Seattle) and US Remote | Full-time
Hey everyone — we're a startup that's scaling a form of durable carbon dioxide removal called enhanced rock weathering. In addition to the critical efforts around decarbonization and emissions mitigations, you might have heard of efforts to scale carbon removal to mop up the remainder. Even so, we need to create an entirely new industry capable of removing tens of billions of tons of CO2 within the next decade.
Our bet at Lithos is that the best chance of success is by leveraging three industries already capable of this scale: agriculture, mining, and transportation. Rock weathering is a key part of the Earth's geologic carbon cycle, and has acted as a crucial ""global thermostat"" to keep Earth habitable — but it normally takes millennia. By enhancing this process, we can speed up the reaction to have meaningful effects within human timescales.
On a day-to-day basis, this involves planning, coordinating, tracking, and optimizing a distributed physical supply chain. We're looking for full-stack engineers, data scientists, and applied statisticians to build the next iteration of our platform under 10x operational growth, and design what will become the ""operating system"" for enhanced weathering at scale. There's a diverse set of challenges spanning interactive geospatial tooling, map and document digitization, laboratory sample management, logistical routing and optimization, and scientific modeling.
We are hiring for Senior-level roles in:
- Full-Stack Engineering
- Data Science & Data Engineering
- Applied Statistics
If you have experience of any kind in farming, commercial agriculture, geospatial data / GIS, farm management software, building tools for semi-technical power users (think Excel/Airtable/Google Earth), or working on offline applications, please mention this in your email - we'd love to hear about it!
You can reach out to us directly via hn [at] lithoscarbon.com

In addition to the critical efforts around decarbonization and emissions mitigations, you might have heard of efforts to scale carbon removal to mop up the remainder. Even so, we need to create an entirely new industry capable of removing tens of billions of tons of CO2 within the next decade.</p><p>Our bet at Lithos is that the best chance of success is by leveraging three industries already capable of this scale: agriculture, mining, and transportation. Rock weathering is a key part of the Earth's geologic carbon cycle, and has acted as a crucial ""global thermostat"" to keep Earth habitable — but it normally takes millennia. By enhancing this process, we can speed up the reaction to have meaningful effects within human timescales.</p><p>On a day-to-day basis, this involves planning, coordinating, tracking, and optimizing a distributed physical supply chain. We're looking for full-stack engineers, data scientists, and applied statisticians to build the next iteration of our platform under 10x operational growth, and design what will become the ""operating system"" for enhanced weathering at scale. There's a diverse set of challenges spanning interactive geospatial tooling, map and document digitization, laboratory sample management, logistical routing and optimization, and scientific modeling.</p><p>We are hiring for Senior-level roles in:</p><p>- Full-Stack Engineering</p><p>- Data Science &amp; Data Engineering</p><p>- Applied Statistics</p><p>If you have experience of any kind in farming, commercial agriculture, geospatial data / GIS, farm management software, building tools for semi-technical power users (think Excel/Airtable/Google Earth), or working on offline applications, please mention this in your email - we'd love to hear about it!</p><p>You can reach out to us directly via hn [at] lithoscarbon.com</p></div>

Streak (www.streak.com) is a CRM built on Gmail. We’re a remote-first team of 35 people across North America. We’re growing and very profitable, and we have customers that love our product. We’re currently in the goldilocks zone of having product market fit with real revenue but also a really flat hierarchy where you can ship fast.
We want to accelerate product delivery (there’s so much to build!) so we’re looking to bring on high agency and experienced frontend engineers to work on high impact product features / frontend infrastructure. We’re building a small, focused, high performing frontend engineering team that works directly with the CEO leading the product. To help build this great team, we offer incredibly competitive compensation (based on Bay Area bands) and some interesting benefits(https://www.streak.com/careers#benefits). We want you to do the best work of your career here, so you should expect high autonomy and ownership.
Lastly, we believe the traditional interview process isn’t well correlated with an engineers’ ability to ship product. Instead, our interview process mimics what it’s actually like to work here. It’s highly asynchronous, favors writing and involves building something useful. We think this will give you a really good insight into our team and company and of course lets us assess if you’ll thrive here.

Crusoe is on a mission to align the future of computing with the future of the climate.
Data centers consume more than 2% of the world's electricity. We power data centers with stranded energy such as gas flares and underloaded renewables , so for every GPU hour you use on Crusoe Cloud, you're offsetting 0.5kg of CO2e, or approximately 4.4 metric tons over an entire year. The more compute you use, the more CO2 and other greenhouse gasses you offset.
Crusoe Cloud (https://crusoe.ai/cloud) offers the cleanest and lowest-cost GPU cloud computing solution in the world for workloads including graphical rendering, artificial intelligence research, machine learning, computational biology, therapeutic drug discovery, simulation and more.

We use WASM to provide isolated runtimes for executing untrusted code, mostly generated by LLMs. Our customers do things like extract data from log lines at run time by asking claude-3-5-sonnet to generate a parsing function on-the-fly and then sending it to us for execution.
Things we need help with:
* Our janky account management dashboard (Postgres / Go / React / TypeScript)
* Our hosted and self-hosted runtime service (Rust, WASM)
* Integrations and demos with adjacent frameworks and tools (Python / JavaScript / TypeScript)
* New products
We have seed money, but the whole company is currently just me and Kyle working out of a converted warehouse on Alabama St. We’re second-time founders, so we know the risk we’re asking you to take and we’re prepared to compensate accordingly.

We're an academic research lab focused on Exploring Earth's Virome, and identifying which viruses could be human disease-causing agents. We are building, Open Virome, an open-source platform to provide scientists with the ability to derive actionable insights from a massive DNA/RNA sequencing database, the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). The SRA houses billions of dollars of data from over 27 million datasets (~100 petabytes raw data) collected over 16 years. By querying, aggregating and displaying relationships between sequencing datasets (and meta-data) and the viruses they contain, we hope to illuminate the hidden universe of viruses all around us.

The remaining 1% is the creative spark of software development and our mission is to enable every dev to focus on this, rather than the tedium that makes coding inaccessible to 99% of humans. Our core tech includes our code knowledge graph, global search index, frontier LLMs (the best proprietary and open-source models with in-house finetuning), and OpenCtx, an open protocol for technical context. Our customers range from startups to the Fortune 500. Our founders still code.

153,kiyanforoughi,2024-08-01 15:47:05,"Needle (Iterative S23) | https://www.askneedle.com | Lead AI Engineer | FULLTIME | REMOTE (US) | West Coast US timezone
About Us
We're Needle. We help small e-commerce brands compete with fewer people and less money using our AI marketing assistant. Brand owners pilot our assistant which connects to everyday tools, crunches data, recommends smart growth ideas, and creates marketing content and campaigns. The result: they cover more marketing ground with less. Our brands grow on average by 53% over 5 months thanks to Needle's ideas. We just launched and already have 100+ brands using us with revenue, traction, and even closed our biggest subscription to date at $2k/month last week.
Why It’s Exciting
Join us at a thrilling stage - small enough to feel like a founding member of a startup, but with clear traction/revenue and about to raise more from investors. We're defining what “AI co-pilots” truly mean in marketing for small brands. This is a team that's helped brands grow for 20+ years and had several exits before. Not random founders. Not a random problem. Not randomly playing around with ""gen ai."" In fact, gen AI is only part of what we do.
Who Are We Looking For?
An entrepreneurial Lead AI Engineer to help us innovate and scale our asset generation across images, video, and HTML generation. Key skills: AI/LLM models, generative technologies, React, and cloud platforms (GCP). Must be in the West Coast US timezone to overlap with part of our back-end/engineering team that sits in Asia (Singapore and Vietnam). Find out more here: https://tinyurl.com/needle-lead-ai-engineer
Perks & Benefits
Co-founder level equity, fair and sensible pay package based on you/where you at, early visibility and ownership across the business. Find out more here: https://tinyurl.com/work-with-needle
Interested?
We're not for everyone. If you want to build using generative technologies with actual use cases that people are paying for, be a sparring partner to founders, enjoy empowering small brands, or care about seeing a 1 to 1mm+ journey, then email Kiyan (CEO) at kiyan@askneedle.com.

Charge Robotics | Senior Mechanical Engineer | Full-time | Onsite | SF Bay Area
Hi HN! We’re a YC-backed startup building robots that build large-scale solar farms. We just got back from the first commercial deployment of our system on a real-world solar construction site.
Check out a video of our system here! https://youtu.be/ZZ2fP1Y5Z2E
It turns out that construction companies literally can't build solar fast enough, so what we're doing is a crucial part of switching the grid over to renewable generation. We're looking to bring another talented mechanical engineer onto our small team.
You’ll be a key contributor, helping bring our next generation of mobile solar factory to life.
Come work with us if you love:
* Fast-paced prototype development with software and hardware components
* Making a positive climate impact through your work
* Hacking on massive construction equipment!

We believe that when users own cryptographic keys, we shift the status quo so that users control more of their data and assets online. Privacy is fundamentally about ownership and revocation. User experience is our North Star, because users won't compromise on UX.

We're a VC-funded startup building an automation platform for Infrastructure-as-Code, adding a Policy-as-Code layer above it, in order to make IaC usable in bigger companies, where you have to take care of state consistency, selective permissions, a usable git flow, etc.
On the backend we're using 100% Go with AWS primitives. We're looking for backend developers who like doing DevOps'y stuff sometimes (because in a way it's the spirit of our company), or have experience with the cloud native ecosystem. Ideally you'd have experience working with an IaC tool, i.e. Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, or SaltStack.
Overall we have a deeply technical product, trying to build something customers love to use, and already have a lot of happy and satisfied customers. We promise interesting work, the ability to open source parts of the project which don't give us a business advantage, as well as healthy working hours. We've also got investment days on Fridays, when you can work on anything you want, as long as it could possibly benefit Spacelift in some way.
If that sounds like fun to you, please apply at https://spacelift.teamtailor.com/jobs/3006934-software-engin...

We’re creating robots that autonomously construct buildings. We design all of our hardware and software in-house in central Amsterdam, and we’re starting with autonomous bricklaying robots.
We have built a machine vision pipeline that can achieve sub-millimetre localisation on construction sites, and a neat software stack that lets us configure and control robots with ease. We’re deploying our robots on real construction sites and have started making the first revenue from our bricklaying-as-a-service model.
The software team is now seven people (~30 people overall), and continuing to grow. There’s strong customer demand for what we’re building, and we’re starting to scale up robot production to meet it.
Our stack is mostly: Rust, TypeScript, Python, NixOS.
