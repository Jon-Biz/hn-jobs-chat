We’ve built an end-to-end insurance billing system for recurring care, starting with Autism clinics.\nHealthcare in the United States runs on private and public insurance billing, but providers spend huge amounts of time on faxes, phone calls, and error-prone legacy systems to get paid. That’s not why they got into care.\nWhat’s worse, these systems aren’t hugely successful—clinics regularly get back 80% what they know the insurance company should pay. Those missing dollars could be used to hire more care providers to help more kids, but instead line insurance companies’ pockets.\nWe’re changing that.\nAt Juniper, we’ve built an end-to-end billing system. It starts with ingesting from a clinic’s EHR, then create, validates, and submits claims to insurance providers across the country. If claims need corrections or appeals, most of the time we can handle those automatically or our CX and Operations team use our in-house internal tools. We also handle patient invoicing for co-pays, co-insurance, and deductibles (we never send anything to collections.)\nOur typical paid rate is above 95%.\nWe are a team of 25 with strong product market fit—we’ve had to push out onboardings because engineering can’t build quickly enough.\nYou’ll be working with an engineering leadership team from AWS and Stripe to get doctors and clinicians back to work helping kids.\nEmail me at chris@juniperplatform.com"

I think a former or future founder would do well in this role.\nCuriosity matters more than domain-specific experience in bioinformatics, although some bioinformatics context is helpful: understanding if what you've built solves a problem requires talking to users and understanding them.\nYou would be working in a few key areas of our product:\n- Improving our integration with bioinformatics pipelining languages like Nextflow and Snakemake.\n- Building our core API. This is currently written with Express/Node.js with a Postgres database.\n- Building the UI for launching, monitoring, and sharing bioinformatics pipelines and data. This is currently written in React with Typescript.\n- Improving our pipeline execution. This is mostly in AWS Batch.\n- Improving our data handling. Most raw data is stored in S3, with metadata in a Postgres database.\nWe're a very small team, and we plan to stay small until we have strong product-market fit. We're funded by Y Combinator, have revenue from the FlowDeploy product, and can keep going for years without raising additional funding.\nInterested?
