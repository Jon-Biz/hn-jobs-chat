Over the last 7 years I’ve been at YC, our software team has grown considerably both in engineers and in products. We need to invest more in our infrastructure so we can keep shipping our products quickly.\nThe main thing you’ll need in this job is curiosity; I work at every layer of a very large stack. One day you might dig into AWS apis, another it’s a 3rd party Ruby gem or our git history. Or maybe you get paged that all the SSDs for Hacker News (primary and standby!) died on the same day :) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32028511.\nThe first few months will be heavier on infrastructure work but in the future the job will hopefully be equal parts developer experience, infrastructure work, and product engineering that impacts all of our products (think SSO, sending email, security, etc).\nThe main products we support are all Ruby on Rails apps running in AWS (mostly in ECS); ideally you’ve already worked on apps like that. You have at least 5 years of experience. Part of that was shipping code to customers but you’ve also got cloud experience (we try to mostly use Terraform). You’re probably the person people turn to when there’s a fire to put out.\nYC has excellent compensation and benefits (see more in the formal job description below). The team and the work life balance are great. About half of us are former founders and many of us are parents. And if you’re curious about startups (and possibly starting one someday), this job gives you amazing access to interact with YC’s programs, partners, and founders.\nIf you’re interested, I’d love to chat!

We're also building a fast, modern web interface to allow for a smoother experience. Servicing our users is top priority.\nThe Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python, C++ (replacing still present Erlang[ß]), Rust and Javascript for React & React-Native, relying heavily on asynchronous programming techniques. The tech stack sports Kafka, Postgres and Kubernetes. We use REST where we can. Life at Smarkets circles around people, version control, configuration management and automation. We can - and do - deploy to production several times a day.\nOur entire production is in AWS.

We offer a comprehensive set of tools that help our Fortune 500 clients understand and improve how they’re perceived in the marketplace, how aware consumers are of the value they provide, and how much consumers trust them to provide the value they promise.\nWe've been rapidly expanding our list of enterprise customers and deepening our integrations with \"household name\" partners like Amazon and Clorox. As we grow, we need engineers to help us build even more unique, differentiated, valuable, scalable, and robust analytical SaaS tools and products.\nAbout the Role:\nUpwave is a startup and we need an experienced generalist “startup engineer” who’s excited about doing the wide variety of technical work that modern SaaS startups need. That includes backend web development (JVM frameworks), frontend SPA development (mostly React), AWS-based cloud engineering, and some data engineering.

We offer a comprehensive set of tools that help our Fortune 500 clients understand and improve how they’re perceived in the marketplace, how aware consumers are of the value they provide, and how much consumers trust them to provide the value they promise.</p><p>We've been rapidly expanding our list of enterprise customers and deepening our integrations with \"household name\" partners like Amazon and Clorox. As we grow, we need engineers to help us build even more unique, differentiated, valuable, scalable, and robust analytical SaaS tools and products.</p><p>About the Role:</p><p>Upwave is a startup and we need an experienced generalist “startup engineer” who’s excited about doing the wide variety of technical work that modern SaaS startups need. That includes backend web development (JVM frameworks), frontend SPA development (mostly React), AWS-based cloud engineering, and some data engineering. We are also particularly interested in someone who knows (or is interested in learning) the intricacies of our industry and our business and who is comfortable leading conversations with customers and partners to scope, define, and execute the technical integrations that have become one of our major levers of growth.

Maddox AI is an asset-light SaaS solution, which addresses those visual inspection tasks that are still performed manually, as conventional (=rule-based) computer vision methods fail. In product development, we closely collaborate with leading AI researchers from the Cyber Valley. Prof. Dr. Matthias Bethge, Prof. Dr. Alexander Ecker and Dr. Wieland Brendel have been researching in the field of machine learning and computer vision for years and are part of our founding team.\nMaddox AI is used by DAX-30 companies as well as by large medium-sized enterprises. Our team consists of scientists, former strategy consultants, mechanical engineers, and software engineers. We know that Maddox AI's success is only made possible by our unique team. As we continue to grow, we want to convince the best and brightest minds of our mission to establish Maddox AI as the modern quality management platform.\nWe are looking for new colleagues for the following position:\n(Senior) Software Engineer, Edge (m/f/d) | ONSITE Tuebingen | (https://maddox-ai-gmbh.jobs.personio.de/job/894530?display=e...)\n- Main Technologies: Python3, PyQT/QML <- If you are good in one of those, we want to get to know you :)\n- Other Technologies: Ubuntu, (Embedded) Linux, ONNX, TenorRT, CUDA, Nvidia Jetson Platform, L4T, Systemd, neoapi\nAs part of the edge software team, you will contribute to the development of our edge software framework, which is crucial to enable running models in nearly real time on the customer's manufacturing site. Your code will be responsible to connect all the dots: from image acquisition via our industrial cams, integrating cutting-edge machine-learning techniques into low-latency edge environments, providing industry-standard interfaces for full automation to implementing UI components for our touchscreen interface, and communicating with our cloud infrastructure.

Maddox AI is an asset-light SaaS solution, which addresses those visual inspection tasks that are still performed manually, as conventional (=rule-based) computer vision methods fail. In product development, we closely collaborate with leading AI researchers from the Cyber Valley. Prof. Dr. Matthias Bethge, Prof. Dr. Alexander Ecker and Dr. Wieland Brendel have been researching in the field of machine learning and computer vision for years and are part of our founding team.</p><p>Maddox AI is used by DAX-30 companies as well as by large medium-sized enterprises. Our team consists of scientists, former strategy consultants, mechanical engineers, and software engineers. We know that Maddox AI's success is only made possible by our unique team.

Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.\nMoreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.\nHow can this be, and how can we change it?\nNuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.\nToday, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.\nBut -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?\nAbsolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.\nIn 2022, Nuna will power over $70Bn of healthcare payments for over 6.5mn patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.\nNuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry’s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts.

We operate HPC environments for researchers, we do one-time consultations on projects (from software and pipelines, to data management, to physical building design and fit-out), and we provide contract support for individual Labs, Departments, and Schools.\nWe have five open positions:\n• Research Storage Systems Developer: We're launching an on-prem tape-based S3-speaking archival storage service. It's going to use Lustre, Phobos, and MinIO. We're looking for someone to help with software development and administration of this new service. Keywords: Go, MinIO, S3, Python. You'll be working with the folks who run our Oak \"Cheap and Deep\" storage service.\n• Computational Consultant: This is a generalist position for someone with a lot of education or experience. You'll work with researchers—from Nobel-winning Faculty to new graduate students—to map their needs to our available services, and to identify directions for us to grow. You'll be working with other consultants in our group, as well as cluster admins. Keywords: R, Python, Jupyter, conda, SLURM, OpenMP, MPI.\n• Research Computing Systems Specialist, SDSS: The Doerr School of Sustainability is one of our largest clients. They use our primary research cluster (Sherlock); and they also have their own cluster, which you'll be responsible for. You'll have a lot of contact with Doerr School Faculty, Graduate Students, and Postdocs. Keywords: Python, C, Fortran, MPI, and large jobs. You'll be working with our in-group SME, and the two sysadmins who run Sherlock. If you're a sysadmin, but not an HPC sysadmin, you should still apply.\n• Stanford CryoEM Center (cEMc) Computational Resources and Data Management Specialist: Within the School of Medicine, this is a new Center, providing cryoEM equipment and services to researchers. cEMc is looking for someone who ideally has both cryoEM and Linux experience, who can advise researchers on their workflows and pipelines. You'll be a bridge between the researchers and us, helping to design workflows and pipelines that automate things as much as possible, within the limits of a shared HPC environment.\n• Data Center Engineer: You're part of the SRCC, but based full-time at our primary research data center in Menlo Park (on the SLAC campus). This position includes everything from racking and cabling to maintaining and troubleshooting power distribution (415v Starline bus), UPS (spinning-mass), generators, VFDs, air handlers, chillers, PLCs, and the like.\nAll four positions are hybrid, except the data center engineer is fully onsite. If you don't already live in the Bay Area, I believe we provide a relocation incentive. Depending on where you live, we provide free transit passes. Unfortunately, if you don't commute, you will have to pay for parking for the days you're on-site. Work benefits are all publicly documented at https://cardinalatwork.stanford.edu/benefits-rewards.

We operate HPC environments for researchers, we do one-time consultations on projects (from software and pipelines, to data management, to physical building design and fit-out), and we provide contract support for individual Labs, Departments, and Schools.</p><p>We have five open positions:</p><p>• Research Storage Systems Developer: We're launching an on-prem tape-based S3-speaking archival storage service.  It's going to use Lustre, Phobos, and MinIO.  We're looking for someone to help with software development and administration of this new service.  Keywords: Go, MinIO, S3, Python. You'll be working with the folks who run our Oak \"Cheap and Deep\" storage service.</p><p>• Computational Consultant: This is a generalist position for someone with a lot of education or experience. You'll work with researchers—from Nobel-winning Faculty to new graduate students—to map their needs to our available services, and to identify directions for us to grow.  You'll be working with other consultants in our group, as well as cluster admins.  Keywords: R, Python, Jupyter, conda, SLURM, OpenMP, MPI.</p><p>• Research Computing Systems Specialist, SDSS: The Doerr School of Sustainability is one of our largest clients. They use our primary research cluster (Sherlock); and they also have their own cluster, which you'll be responsible for. You'll have a lot of contact with Doerr School Faculty, Graduate Students, and Postdocs.  Keywords: Python, C, Fortran, MPI, and large jobs. You'll be working with our in-group SME, and the two sysadmins who run Sherlock.  If you're a sysadmin, but not an HPC sysadmin, you should still apply.</p><p>• Stanford CryoEM Center (cEMc) Computational Resources and Data Management Specialist: Within the School of Medicine, this is a new Center, providing cryoEM equipment and services to researchers. cEMc is looking for someone who ideally has both cryoEM and Linux experience, who can advise researchers on their workflows and pipelines. You'll be a bridge between the researchers and us, helping to design workflows and pipelines that automate things as much as possible, within the limits of a shared HPC environment.</p><p>• Data Center Engineer: You're part of the SRCC, but based full-time at our primary research data center in Menlo Park (on the SLAC campus). This position includes everything from racking and cabling to maintaining and troubleshooting power distribution (415v Starline bus), UPS (spinning-mass), generators, VFDs, air handlers, chillers, PLCs, and the like.</p><p>All four positions are hybrid, except the data center engineer is fully onsite. If you don't already live in the Bay Area, I believe we provide a relocation incentive. Depending on where you live, we provide free transit passes. Unfortunately, if you don't commute, you will have to pay for parking for the days you're on-site.

Also knows how Web apps work and can understand the similarities and differences between apps and websites.\nI started as an engineer on our SDK focused team working on deep internals of Android for a couple of years, but as our Mobile product started to get more customers, it became clear that the way we process Mobile sessions and find interesting insights wasn't evolving. Our team is focused on helping teams build features for our Mobile product without having to understand the nitty gritty details of our SDK and mobile specific data structures.\nIf you're not familiar with FS, here's my take on the elevator pitch:\nFullStory builds the best product analytics + session replay tools to help you understand what is frustrating your users and preventing them from using your Mobile App or Website. FullStory automatically capture what your users saw, what they interacted with, and all the information you'd need to power your product analytics, and lets watch how your users are using your app or website in a video-like experience, all with best in class privacy preserving features. With FullStory, You can delete all your manually instrumented Analytics.event(\"Login Clicked\"), and use our APIs to instrument only the events and data that matter to your app or site\nI've worked here for 3.5 years, and I still think there's so many interesting problems to solve and tools to build - here's a little about the history and what excites me about our future.\nFor websites, the problem is a lot simpler - there are APIs to listen for changes to the HTML structure. There’s nothing really close to that on mobile that provides any sort of structured vector representation of the UI and View Tree Hierarchy. Most of the competitors in this space are all either based on Bitmaps, screenshots, or don’t provide any sort of a session replay experience (focusing on the analytics only case). Ours is based on different paradigm. We can selectively capture the colors, shapes, text, etc. that a View would draw to a canvas. Why is this better? If a view contains sensitive information, we can still capture the shapes, colors, paths of the view, but omit the actual text or bitmap content of that view.\nThis role is particularly exciting because we’re just scratching the surface with what the higher fidelity our SDK captures can do. Imagine automatically surfacing when your users are spending a long time looking at ProgressBars or UIActivityIndicatorViews and how that impacts your conversions without needing to log any events, metrics or write code. Our team will have an outsized impact on the success of our mobile product, and the person who fills this role will strongly influence that impact and build a lot of the the fundamental building blocks that power those features.\nIf this sounds interesting, apply here: https://www.fullstory.com/careers/jobs/56457178-344f-47c7-98...",
