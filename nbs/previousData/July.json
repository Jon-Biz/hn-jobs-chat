Speed: we typically work on projects that go live between 1 month and 6 months. (We launched GPT based summaries and knowledge base in the contact center in 4 weeks)\n2. Lots of greenfield work: we have the privilege of building the apps and sites that support new products. Lots of opportunities to build things from scratch here. (For examples of our products, see doorpakken.abnamro.nl)\n3. Mixed teams: our total group is about 70 people, which contains everything from data scientists to software and platform engineers. For proposition development we pair with internal entrepreneurs.\nAvailable roles:\n- starting and junior developers (iOS, android, ‘full stack’). Our stack is Vue3 with backends in Java or Python.\n- Great data profiles, that want to make impact with data and AI. We currently have people ranging from hard-core deep data scientists to practical integrators that deliver data enabled solutions very quickly.\nWe’re open to various profiles, as long as you get energy from delivering working software/solutions to clients quickly. If you think you might be a fit, feel free to reach out for a discussion.\nMust live in the Netherlands to be employed, but we’re very flexible about remote work.

        "comment": "Stainless | Founding Engineer | NYC ONSITE | Full-time\nStainless is building the platform for high-quality, easy-to-use APIs.\nOur first product is SDKs as a service – you send us your OpenAPI spec, and we generate pacakges in all the major languages and publish them to npm/pypi/etc (think `npm install your-company`). These SDKs are world-class: you get an idiomatic wrapper with autocomplete, types, etc. (I built a version of this at Stripe for their SDKs, and am now building a better version for everyone.)\nNext, we want to make it easy to build amazing REST APIs. REST is simple and ubiquitous, but right now it’s also messy, chaotic, and hard to get right.

It's insanely fun to work on and we have a shot at building a huge business in the connected urban farming space.

We want to see open source silicon occupy a similar position to open source software (e.g. look at Linux, it's the default choice in many applications, we'd like open source silicon to be used for similar foundational technologies in the hardware world).\nOur major project focus is OpenTitan: https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan it’s a silicon root of trust being built and funded by a collaboration of major companies, such as Google, Western Digital, Seagate, Winbond and Rivos amongst others. lowRISC stewards the project as well as performing a significant proportion of the engineering work.\nWe’ve just announced the RTL freeze for the first OpenTitan tapeout, a discrete chip, named Earl Grey: https://lowrisc.org/blog/2023/06/opentitans-rtl-freeze-lever...\nWe’re looking for verification and infrastructure engineers to join us. We work in System Verilog and use UVM, though plan to expand our use of formal verification. We’re also keen to explore new innovative ways to verify designs.\nA key responsibility for lowRISC is maintaining the CI and regression infrastructure for OpenTitan. This is a complex system running many different tools across different machines (both cloud and on-site) and involves FPGAs and custom hardware. We use ansible and terraform to manage it all. We’re seeking an infrastructure engineer to maintain and scale the system as well as architect and build new facets of it.\nlowRISC is headquartered in Cambridge, UK and we have an office in Zürich, Switzerland. We utilize a hybrid working model.\nWe offer competitive salaries (see job ads for ranges) and a generous pension (12.5% employer contribution in the UK), you can find our individual job postings here: https://lowrisc.applytojob.com/apply/\nFeel free to email me at gac@lowrisc.org if you’ve got any questions.",

We want to see open source silicon occupy a similar position to open source software (e.g. look at Linux, it's the default choice in many applications, we'd like open source silicon to be used for similar foundational technologies in the hardware world).</p><p>Our major project focus is OpenTitan: <a href=\"https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan\">https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan</a> it’s a silicon root of trust being built and funded by a collaboration of major companies, such as Google, Western Digital, Seagate, Winbond and Rivos amongst others. lowRISC stewards the project as well as performing a significant proportion of the engineering work.</p><p>We’ve just announced the RTL freeze for the first OpenTitan tapeout, a discrete chip, named Earl Grey: <a href=\"https://lowrisc.org/blog/2023/06/opentitans-rtl-freeze-leveraging-transparency-to-create-trustworthy-computing/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://lowrisc.org/blog/2023/06/opentitans-rtl-freeze-lever...</a></p><p>We’re looking for verification and infrastructure engineers to join us. We work in System Verilog and use UVM, though plan to expand our use of formal verification. We’re also keen to explore new innovative ways to verify designs.</p><p>A key responsibility for lowRISC is maintaining the CI and regression infrastructure for OpenTitan. This is a complex system running many different tools across different machines (both cloud and on-site) and involves FPGAs and custom hardware. We use ansible and terraform to manage it all. We’re seeking an infrastructure engineer to maintain and scale the system as well as architect and build new facets of it.</p><p>lowRISC is headquartered in Cambridge, UK and we have an office in Zürich, Switzerland. We utilize a hybrid working model.</p><p>We offer competitive salaries (see job ads for ranges) and a generous pension (12.5% employer contribution in the UK), you can find our individual job postings here: <a href=\"https://lowrisc.applytojob.com/apply/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://lowrisc.applytojob.com/apply/</a></p><p>Feel free to email me at gac@lowrisc.org if you’ve got any questions.</p></div>\n              <div class=\"reply\">        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                  </font>\n      </p></div></div></td></tr>\n        </tbody></table></td></tr>"

It's surprisingly hard to make a map today, and people in 15+ industries rely on them to do their jobs. Climate change and the resulting natural disasters are forcing even more people to become map-makers, and Felt is here to meet that need. It's the first easy-to-use collaborative mapping software, founded by a team of technologists with a proven track-record. My co-founder and CEO, Sam, is a former YC founder who sold his previous company [1] and I'm an early Uber engineer.\nWe are on the lookout for our next frontend engineers. At this role, you will help build our beautiful interactive mapping front-end, pushing the boundaries of what's possible on an infinite canvas. Ideal candidates will have experience with Canvas, WebGL and other web graphics technologies, comfortable with complex UIs that work in multiplayer settings.

It's surprisingly hard to make a map today, and people in 15+ industries rely on them to do their jobs. Climate change and the resulting natural disasters are forcing even more people to become map-makers, and Felt is here to meet that need. It's the first easy-to-use collaborative mapping software, founded by a team of technologists with a proven track-record. My co-founder and CEO, Sam, is a former YC founder who sold his previous company [1] and I'm an early Uber engineer.</p><p>We are on the lookout for our next frontend engineers. At this role, you will help build our beautiful interactive mapping front-end, pushing the boundaries of what's possible on an infinite canvas. Ideal candidates will have experience with Canvas, WebGL and other web graphics technologies, comfortable with complex UIs that work in multiplayer settings.

Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.\nMoreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.\nHow can this be, and how can we change it?\nNuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.\nToday, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.\nBut -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?\nAbsolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.\nIn 2022, Nuna will power over $70Bn of healthcare payments for over 6.5mn patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.\nNuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people.
