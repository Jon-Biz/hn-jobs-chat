We're re-thinking everything, down to the level of ditching IEEE floating point in favor of our own, improved, format. All that's left to do is draw the rest of the owl. If you're looking for a truly challenging, engaging, and highly rewarding project, you've found it.\nThe software team at Lemurian has three major projects for the year. One is a compiler which ingests models (think GPT-N, BERT, ImageWhatever, etc) and emits assembly the rest of our stack ingests. The second project in the pipeline is to ingest that assembly in a functional simulator (fsim), which emulates the hardware target at a slightly higher level than cycle-accuracy. The third project is tangentially related to, and builds on, the first two; validate the efficacy of the entire system. Some examples might be to analyze the tradeoffs of widening of our arithmetic type (think 8-bit vs 12-bit vs 16-bit), to quantifying the pressure on the L1 bus for different layers in BERT, to the efficiency tradeoffs between tiling a matrix multiply in one way, vs another.\nThe team at Lemurian is absolutely phenominal. There are plenty of 25-year-plus career engineers on the team, both on the hardware and software sides. The majority of the team have come from companies like 3dfx, nVidia, Intel, AMD, Google .. you get the idea.

Fully funded medical, dental, and vision insurance. Unlimited vacation (with mandatory MINIMUM vacation time). Flexible hours. Incredible, cohesive team with the hardest and most interesting problems to solve. We work together onsite in a highly collaborative environment.\nWe're doing things nobody has done before, so we don't need familiarity with any particular language, framework, domain, or anything like that. Don't care. (But if you love Nix...we should talk.) What we do care about: you're smart, get things done, a joy to work with, and are comfortable dealing with open-ended problems.\nApply at https://antithesis.breezy.hr/ (Don't worry too much about which role you choose.

If you are excited about turning something that has historically been a negative experience (maintenance) into a positive experience, we'd love to talk with you.</p><p>Stack: Python, Django, Typescript, React, PostgreSQL</p><p>Senior Software Engineer: <a href=\"https://property-meld.breezy.hr/p/80f57aad2cca-senior-software-engineer\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://property-meld.breezy.hr/p/80f57aad2cca-senior-softwa...</a></p><p>Engineering Manager: <a href=\"https://property-meld.breezy.hr/p/f98de30fb768-engineering-manager\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://property-meld.breezy.hr/p/f98de30fb768-engineering-m...</a></p><p>If you are interested or have any questions email us at tech.jobs@propertymeld.com or apply via the above links.</p></div>\n              <div class=\"reply\">        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                  </font>\n      </p></div></div></td></tr>\n        </tbody></table></td></tr>"

We operate in very collaborative and strategic relationships with our clients and partners which gives us a uniquely strategic seat at the table and the opportunity to regularly deep dive into a new interesting understanding of our client's business, then build, launch, and evolve new software products from the ground up.\nOur services include CTO consulting, software development, UX/UI, training and capabilities building. We work with large and small companies/startups on projects ranging from 2-12 months with 2-10 people on each project to build full stack web, mobile, IoT, physical installations, etc. Our favorite stack is Typescript, React, React Native, Node (recently loving Remix!). We also use a wide range of other tech as needed since we face a pretty diverse set of challenges. Recent and upcoming examples: Flutter, Elixir/Phoenix, Rails, Swift, and Kotlin. We are a remote-first company but with very active collaboration on video and Slack. Occasional travel to San Francisco and other locations is part of the job for project kickoffs and other critical collaboration phases or meetings.\nWe are looking for people who are excited about building great software products, who are great teammates, and who are passionate about continuously refining best practices for creating successful digital products. Experience in dev team leadership, new product development, collaboration with business and design stakeholders, and consulting experience are not required but are all huge plusses.\nSpecifically, right now we are looking for:\n- Sr full stack developers\n- Lead level full stack devs with experience in team leadership roles\n- A design-gineer.\nFor that last role, we're working on a cool internal design-tech project and need an awesome UX designer who also understands code and dev workflow.\nInterested? We want to hear from you! Please send resume, Github, or LinkedIn to jobs@blackbird.us. I am a founder so ask me anything! If there are other aspects of what we do that interest you definitely still hit me up!",

By joining us, you will work full-time on open-source, pushing your changes to free software projects upstream through pull requests, contributing features, documentation, or help on public forums.\nWe care deeply about contributing our work upstream. You will see the results of your work reused and recognized across the educational community, increasing access to quality education for everyone, everywhere.\nRemote-first\nUnlike companies who reluctantly started to accept remote workers recently, we have embraced it from day 1. For the past 7 years, we have based and refined our way of working around remote-friendly workflows, from the ground up. No day-long video meetings, mandatory work hours, or risk of being forced back into an office one day -- as long as you have a good internet connection, it’s none of our business when or where you work from. :)\nWe are all working remotely, from all continents (except Antarctica, at least so far - applicants welcome!). We use remote-friendly and timezone-agnostic workflows based on asynchronous principles and good documentation practices.\nOnline education\nWe are one of the main contributors to the Open edX project, the main open-source MOOC platform created by MIT, Harvard and many other top universities. It powers sites like edX.org, the MIT Open Learning Library, and the national online learning platform for France. We provide development and hosting for institutions like Harvard Medical School, Harvard LabXchange, Cloudera, Autodesk, and several governments. We are not affiliated with edX.org, but we contribute and work with them on various projects.\nOur handbook, like much of our work, is publicly viewable and you can find it at https://handbook.opencraft.com/.\nApply for this Position\nSee the full details and apply at https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/\nJob description: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VgA7geR5oAsHzTRnldm6KU7L...",

You will see the results of your work reused and recognized across the educational community, increasing access to quality education for everyone, everywhere.</p><p>Remote-first</p><p>Unlike companies who reluctantly started to accept remote workers recently, we have embraced it from day 1. For the past 7 years, we have based and refined our way of working around remote-friendly workflows, from the ground up. No day-long video meetings, mandatory work hours, or risk of being forced back into an office one day -- as long as you have a good internet connection, it’s none of our business when or where you work from. :)</p><p>We are all working remotely, from all continents (except Antarctica, at least so far - applicants welcome!). We use remote-friendly and timezone-agnostic workflows based on asynchronous principles and good documentation practices.</p><p>Online education</p><p>We are one of the main contributors to the Open edX project, the main open-source MOOC platform created by MIT, Harvard and many other top universities. It powers sites like edX.org, the MIT Open Learning Library, and the national online learning platform for France. We provide development and hosting for institutions like Harvard Medical School, Harvard LabXchange, Cloudera, Autodesk, and several governments. We are not affiliated with edX.org, but we contribute and work with them on various projects.</p><p>Our handbook, like much of our work, is publicly viewable and you can find it at <a href=\"https://handbook.opencraft.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://handbook.opencraft.com/</a>.</p><p>Apply for this Position</p><p>See the full details and apply at <a href=\"https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://opencraft.com/jobs/open-source-developer/</a></p><p>Job description: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VgA7geR5oAsHzTRnldm6KU7LK9c7pvbMAbSkt0ihNho/edit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VgA7geR5oAsHzTRnldm6KU7L...</a></p></div>\n              <div class=\"reply\">        <p><font size=\"1\">\n                  </font>\n      </p></div></div></td></tr>\n        </tbody></table></td></tr>"

Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.\nMoreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.\nHow can this be, and how can we change it?\nNuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.\nToday, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.\nBut -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?\nAbsolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.\nIn 2022, Nuna will power over $70Bn of healthcare payments for over 6.5mn patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.\nNuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry’s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts.
